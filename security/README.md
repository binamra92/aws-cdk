## Account Password Policy
This template creates an account password policy for your IAM users. You can:

* set IAM user passwords to be valid for only the specified number of days.
* prevent IAM users from reusing a specified number of previous passwords.
* specify the minimum number of characters allowed in an IAM user password.
* require that IAM user passwords contain at least one lowercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (a to z).
* require that IAM user passwords contain at least one uppercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (A to Z).
* require that IAM user passwords contain at least one numeric character (0 to 9).
* require that IAM user passwords contain at least one nonalphanumeric character.
* permit all IAM users in your account to use the IAM console to change their own passwords.
* prevent IAM users from choosing a new password after their current password has expired.

Or just use the suggested defaults.
