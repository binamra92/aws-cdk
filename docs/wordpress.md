## WordPress: fault tolerant and scalable
Use this CloudFormation template to create a fault tolerant and scalable WordPress environment on AWS.

### Features
* HTTPS only
* CDN caching static files
* Scalable file storage
* Fault tolerance due to multi-AZ setup

### Services
This template combines the following services:
* CloudFront: CDN for dynamic and static content
* ELB: load balancer forwarding requests to EC2 instances and terminating SSL
* EC2: virtual machines running the web servers
* EFS: storage for WordPress files (WordPress core, plugins, themes, user uploads, ...)
* RDS: MySQL database

## Installation Guide
1. This templates depends on our [`vpc-*azs.yaml`](../vpc/) template. <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=vpc-2azs&templateURL=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/widdix-aws-cf-templates/vpc/vpc-2azs.yaml">Launch Stack</a>
1. Create an ACM certificate for your domain name within the region you want to launch your stack in. Copy the ARN of the certificate. This is for the ELB.
1. Create another ACM certificate for your domain in region `us-east-1`. Copy the ARN of the certificate. This is for CloudFront (note: [CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in us-east-1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html))

## Dependencies
* `vpc/vpc-*azs.yaml` (**required**)
* `vpc/vpc-ssh-bastion.yaml` (recommended)
* `security/auth-proxy-*.yaml`
* `operations/alert.yaml` (recommended)

## Limitations
* WordPress will only run in two Availability Zones, even if your VPC stack has more.
* PHP files are cached for 300 seconds on the web servers.
* Static files `wp-includes` and `wp-content` are cached for 15 minutes on the CDN.
* Pre-defined auto-scaling might not be able to cover your requirements and needs load and performance testing.
